## üß† What is GEM Strategy?

The Global Equity Momentum (GEM) strategy, described by Gary Antonacci, is based on a simple principle: invest in assets that have shown the best momentum over the last 12 months (minus one month). The strategy aims to:

- **Avoid prolonged bear markets** by rotating to safer assets
- **Capture upward trends** by staying invested in strong-performing assets
- **Reduce portfolio volatility** through systematic rebalancing
